## Running the program

- First of all go inside the folder
- First install javascript package manager yarn if not present
    - For macOX
        - `brew install yarn`
    - For Linux
        - `npm install --save yarn-install`
- Install dependencies by
	- `yarn install`
- Running the program is easy
	- `yarn start`
- This starts a react-server at **localhost:3000**
- Open **localhost:3000** in a browser

This will make frontend server run but you would still need to have a running backend server to handle request apis from frontend.The backend server needs to run be hosted in **localhost:8080**.

For a sample backend server written in GoLang for this quiz-app click [here](https://github.com/PK1210/Go-Quiz-Backend-Server).
